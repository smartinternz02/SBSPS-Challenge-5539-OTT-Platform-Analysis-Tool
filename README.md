# SBSPS-Challenge-5539-OTT-Platform-Analysis-Tool
OTT (over-the-top) is a means of providing television and film content over the internet at the request and to suit the requirements of the individual consumer.
Through the analysis of such platforms we can gain lots of insight on the customer behavior and interaction with said platforms which can give companies the edge
in providing the content that meet the interest of the customers.This reduces wastage of time and resources put for creating content.
